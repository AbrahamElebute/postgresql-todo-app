# 📝 Monolithic To-Do App — Node.js + SQLite

This is my first **fullstack to-do application**, built with a **monolithic backend** architecture using **Node.js** and **SQLite**. It features a simple yet functional to-do system where you can create, update, and delete tasks — all backed by real database logic and structured routes.

---

## 🚀 Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Node.js + Express
- **Database**: SQLite (`better-sqlite3`)
- **Frontend**: HTML + CSS + JavaScript
- **Auth**: JWT (JSON Web Token) middleware

---

## 📌 Features

- Add, update, and delete todos
- JWT-based user authentication
- Persistent storage with SQLite
- RESTful API routes
- Organized and modular file structure

---

## 🧠 What I Learned

- Building a monolithic backend from scratch
- Structuring an Express app with routing and middleware
- Using SQLite for lightweight database operations
- Implementing authentication using JWT
- Handling CRUD operations with raw SQL
